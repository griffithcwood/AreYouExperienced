<h1>I Don't Live Today</h1>

<h2>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix"> Jimi Hendrix</a></h2>

<pre> 
Will I live tomorrow?
Well I just can't say.
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say.

But I know for sure
I don't live today.

No sun coming through my windows,
Feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave.
No sun coming through my windows,
Feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave.

I wish you'd hurry up 'n' rescue me
So I can be on my mis'rable way

I don't live today;
It's such a shame to waste your time away like this.

Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say.
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
I know for sure
I don't live today.
