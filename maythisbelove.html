<h1>May This Be Love</h1>

Waterfall
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall

I can see
My rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall

Some people say
Daydreaming's for all the, huh
Lazy minded fools
With nothing else to do
So let them laugh, laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
To see me through 
I have nothing to lose
Long as I have you

Waterfall
Don't ever change your ways
Fall with me for a million days
Oh my waterfall
