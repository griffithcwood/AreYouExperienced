<h1>Are You Experienced?</h1>

<h2>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix"> Jimi Hendrix</a></h2>

<pre> 
If you can get your mind together
Then come across to me
We'll hold hands an' then we'll watch the sun rise
From the bottom of the sea
But first

Are You Experienced?
Ah! Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have

I know, I know
You'll probably scream n' cry
That your little world won't let go
But who in your measly little world are trying to
Prove that
You're made out of gold and -a can't be sold

So-er, Are You Experienced?
Ah! Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have

Ah, let me prove it to you
I think they're calling our names
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will
If you just take hold of my hand

Ah! But Are You Experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?

Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful
