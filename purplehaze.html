<h1>Purple Haze</h1>

<h2>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix"> Jimi Hendrix</a></h2>

<p> 
    Purple Haze was in my brain,
<br>
    lately things don't seem the same,
<br>
    actin' funny but I don't know why
<br>
    'Scuse me while I kiss the sky.
<br>
<br>
    Purple Haze all around,
<br>
    don't know if I'm coming up or down.
<br>
    Am I happy or in misery?
<br>
    Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me.
<br>
<br>
    Purple Haze was in my eyes,
<br>
    don't know if it's day or night,
<br>
    you've got me blowing, blowing my mind
<br>
    is it tomorrow or just the end of time?
<br>
