<h1>Manic Depression</h1>

<h2>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix"> Jimi Hendrix</a></h2>

<p> 
    Manic depression is touching my soul
<br>
    I know what I want
<br>
    But I just don't know how to go about getting it
<br>
<br>
    Feeling, sweet feeling
<br>
    Drops from my fingers, fingers
<br>
    Manic depression is captured my soul, yeah
<br>
<br>
    Woman so willing the sweet cause in vain
<br>
    You make love, you break love
<br>
    It's-a all the same when it's, when it's over
<br>
<br>
    Music, sweet music
<br>
    I wish I could caress, caress, caress
<br>
    Manic depression is a frustrating mess
<br>
    Wow
<br>
<br>
    Well, I think I'll go turn myself off an' uh, go on down
<br>
    All the way down
<br>
    Really ain't no use in me hanging around, oh, I gotta see you
<br>
<br>
    Music, sweet music
<br>
    I wish I could caress and uh, kiss, kiss
<br>
    Manic depression is a frustrating mess
<br>
    Wow
<br>
    Yeah
<br>
    Ow
<br>
<br>
    Music, sweet music
<br>
    Music
<br>
    Depression
